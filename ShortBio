My name is Marianne M. Dela Fuente.
I am 19 years old. 
I am an Electronics Engineering student from 2ECE-D in the University of Santo Tomas. 
I have joined two organizations.
One is our local org which is the NECES, wherein I am a staff in the Team Logistics, and 
the other one is IECEP-MSC, wherein I have the position of Auditor. 
Outside UST, I also have an organization or community, I enjoy attending youth service in Victory and bonding and meeting different people from different campuses. 
I am from the province of Bataan, but lately because of the workload from acads and orgs I rarely go home. 
To release my stress, my favorite thing to do is to eat, sleep or watch movies or shows.
